## Steps to Contribute

-   Fork the project to your github account
-   Clone it in your system i.e Linux/Windows
-   Create a new branch for your changes
-   Edit the cloned repository to include your NameCard (these changes should be in the new branch)
-   When done editing, commit your work locally and push it to origin.
-   Make a pull request to our repository with proper description.
-   Let us review your pull request and get it merged to our repository.

## Editing guidelines

- Include your image in the images directory (you'll find this is the public folder) of the cloned repository (Image size should not exceed 1 MB)
- Inside the utils folder, you'll find a file named `contributers.js` , which contains a CONTRIBUTERS array consisting of 2 sample templates. Copy the first template and add it to the end of the array after filling in your details (Don't forget to link your github profile).
- You DO NOT have to change any of the pre-existing files or code, you just need to add your details at the end of the array.
